[b]ARC9[/b] is a modern weapon base and a successor to the ArcCW base that brings customization to an entirely new level. Infinite possibilities with community-crafted content at its core, allowing you to customize your weapon in ways never before possible.

"[i]Once upon a time, when I had barely just started playing Garry's Mod, I dreamed about a weapon base that would truly allow for weapons like nothing else. In 2015, I lacked the skills to make this a reality. After a year in development, I am pleased to report that that is no longer the case.[/i]"
